# Telegram-group-stegano
 
Telegram groups are not encrypted, to add an extra layer of security I created this app!

Ensure that you have the required libraries installed and replace specific values such as Telegram API keys before running the code. This application allows you to encode secret messages within images and decode them later. It also provides cleaning features to remove temporary files generated during the process.
